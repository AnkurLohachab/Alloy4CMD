# Contributing to Alloy4CMD

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Alloy4CMD** â€” a formal modeling framework for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) architecture using Alloy 6.

## ðŸ“˜ Scope of Contributions

We welcome contributions that fall under:

- New Alloy modules for additional DLT components (e.g., identity, privacy extensions)
- Bug fixes or corrections in existing `.als` models
- Improvements to assertions, predicates, or scoping in existing modules
- Examples and test cases demonstrating key properties
- Documentation improvements (e.g., clarifying usage, adding comments)

## ðŸ“„ Before You Contribute

Please keep the following in mind:

- This project is **academic** in nature and currently **under peer review**.
- All contributions must maintain the declarative, typed, and compositional style of Alloy used in the project.
- Large changes or new modules should be proposed first via an issue or email.
