# Alloy4CMD: A Formal Approach for Component-based Modeling of Distributed Ledger Technology Architecture

**Status**: ðŸ“„ Under Revision (Academic Paper)

## Abstract

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) engineering practices commonly rely on the adaptation and development of components as major building blocks.  
However, incorrect component specifications may lead to architectural flaws, further propagating to the implementation stages and causing faulty configurations.  
To this, we take grounds from the declarative modeling widely used in program verification and refactoring for developing correct-by-construction software.

Accordingly, we propose a component-based approach, **Alloy4CMD**, for formal modeling and analysis of DLT architectural design.  
This involves transforming individual components via interpretation into well-formed specifications for decidable reasoning towards property checking.  
We demonstrate how abstract interpretation in the declarative language approximates component semantics, followed by verification towards requirements conformity via typed assertions.  
The analysis involves automated model finding, complemented by proofs for consistency checking.  
The approach facilitates the provisioning of validated and reusable modules as the basis for modeling DLT architecture in the early development stages.

## How to Use

1. **Install [Alloy Analyzer 6](https://alloytools.org/download.html)**
   - Compatible with all major OSes.
   - Required for evaluating `.als` modules.

2. **Open `DLTSystem.als`** in the Alloy Analyzer.
   - This file includes high-level assertions such as `NoDoubleSpend`, `OnlyDUInvokesService`, and `DecisionImpliesLedgerTip`.
   - Use the *Check* and *Run* buttons to explore system properties and generate instances.

3. **Explore Components Individually**
   - Each module (e.g., `Telemetry.als`, `Governance.als`) defines typed predicates, assertions, and facts for modular DLT modeling.
   - Assertions can be checked in isolation for local analysis.

## Goals

âœ… Formalize reusable building blocks for DLT architecture  
âœ… Enable early-stage design verification via lightweight formal methods  
âœ… Provide decidable, analyzable models to detect design flaws early  
âœ… Encourage community contributions for new modules and scenarios

## Notes

- The project is part of an ongoing academic effort and may evolve based on reviewer feedback.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome once the repository is public.
