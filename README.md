# Alloy4CMD: A Formal Approach for Component-based Modeling of Distributed Ledger Technology Architecture

**Status**: ðŸ“„ Under Revision (Academic Paper)

## Abstract

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) system design increasingly emphasizes component-based development, where modular specifications serve as foundational building blocks. However, imprecise or incomplete component specifications can introduce architectural inconsistencies that propagate through to implementation, leading to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. To address this, we leverage declarative modeling techniquesâ€”commonly employed in formal verification and program refactoringâ€”to support correct-by-construction design. We introduce **Alloy4CMD**, a component-oriented framework for the formal specification and analysis of DLT architectures using Alloy. The approach systematically interprets individual components into well-formed specifications amenable to decidable reasoning and property verification. By applying abstract interpretation within Alloy, we approximate component semantics and validate requirements through typed assertions. Our analysis leverages automated model search and logical consistency checks, enabling the construction of reusable and analyzable modules that support rigorous architectural modeling in the early stages of DLT system development.

## How to Use

1. **Install [Alloy Analyzer 6](https://alloytools.org/download.html)**
   - Compatible with all major OSes.
   - Required for evaluating `.als` modules.

2. **Open `DLTSystem.als`** in the Alloy Analyzer.
   - This file includes high-level assertions such as `NoDoubleSpend`, `OnlyDUInvokesService`, and `DecisionImpliesLedgerTip`.
   - Use the *Check* and *Run* buttons to explore system properties and generate instances.

3. **Explore Components Individually**
   - Each module (e.g., `Telemetry.als`, `Governance.als`) defines typed predicates, assertions, and facts for modular DLT modeling.
   - Assertions can be checked in isolation for local analysis.

## Goals

âœ… Formalize reusable building blocks for DLT architecture  
âœ… Enable early-stage design verification via lightweight formal methods  
âœ… Provide decidable, analyzable models to detect design flaws early  
âœ… Encourage community contributions for new modules and scenarios

## Notes

- The project is part of an ongoing academic effort and may evolve based on reviewer feedback.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome once the repository is public.
